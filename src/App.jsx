                <p>In this project, I created a Piano and it was inspired by Manual do Dev channel on Youtube! <br />
                If you are a musician like me, this is a project that you can't miss out on! <br />
                I am sure that, with the skills you learn by working on this project, you will be able to reach way more complex solutions for applications like this one! <br />
                Something interesting about this piano is the possibility to choose between showing the keys or not by clicking on the switch button.
